As an avid SoundCloud user (I have too many playlists), I've always wished it was easier to pull a tracklist — or Shazams — into a SoundCloud playlist. Right now it requires a lot of manual searching, so I built a mini app to find each track for me. Then friends pointed out they'd want the same thing on Spotify, YouTube, and Apple Music — so it does all four.

If you're constantly crate digging, or found a set on YouTube with a tracklist you love, this helps you find the individual tracks much more easily. Paste the list, pick your platform, click through the search links, mark tracks as you add them. Progress saves to your browser so you can come back to it.

**Live site:** https://track-finder.vercel.app

## Usage

1. Visit [track-finder.vercel.app](https://track-finder.vercel.app) (or open `index.html` locally)
2. Paste a tracklist — one track per line
3. Click **Generate**
4. Click **Search** next to each track to find it on SoundCloud (auto-marks it done)
5. Or use **Open next 10** to batch-open the next ten in new tabs

Progress is saved in `localStorage`, so you can close the tab and come back later. Named playlists are kept in a saved list on the input screen.

## Supported formats

One track per line. The parser handles most common formats:

```
Artist - Title
Artist — Title        (em dash, with or without spaces)
Artist – Title        (en dash)
Artist: Title
Artist | Title
Artist<TAB>Title      (paste from a spreadsheet)
1. Artist - Title     (numbered list)
• Artist - Title      (bulleted list)
"Artist" - "Title"    (quotes are stripped)
```

Hyphenated names like `D-Nox` survive because the hyphen splitter requires a space on at least one side. Lines with no recognized separator are searched as a single phrase.

## Features

- Zero dependencies — single HTML file, no build step
- Progress tracking with `localStorage` persistence
- Named saved playlists you can return to
- Batch-open the next 10 undone tracks in new tabs
- `Ctrl+Enter` / `⌘+Enter` in the textarea to generate
- Mobile-friendly

## Deployment

Hosted on Vercel as a static site, linked to this repo — pushes to the default branch auto-deploy.

To deploy your own fork:

```bash
npx vercel        # preview deployment
npx vercel --prod # production
```

No build step or `vercel.json` required — Vercel serves `index.html` from the repo root.
